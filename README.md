## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I do not have a scientific calculator software on my PC. As a result I have to carry my hardware calculator with me whenever I want to study a maths related course.But I want a software version on my PC that I can launch at any time and start using. This project is intended to solve that problem for myself and the many PC users out there who would love to have a software version of the ES PLUS calculator. Your contribution to this project is highly welcome. 

## WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
I used the python tkinter module. Nothing unique. Tried my best to comment out the code in a way that anyone with basic knowledge in python will understand.

## Setup:
$ git clone https://github.com/PatrickAttankurugu/Scientific-Calculator

$ cd Scientific-Calculator

# I will appreciate this
