## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1 project, 1 developer,190 lines of code, 13 hours of programming.I had plenty of time to spare so I thought of creating this app for the  fun of it.

## WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
I used the python tkinter module. Nothing unique. Tried my best to comment out the code in a way that anyone with basic knowledge in python will understand.

## Setup:
$ git clone https://github.com/PatrickAttankurugu/Scientific-Calculator

$ cd Scientific-Calculator

# I will appreciate this
 Please let me know how I can improve. However, if you are a beginner,go ahead and clone this project and try your hands on it. Let me know if you think I can be of help to you.
